Double-sided marking is available, please contact us for details. Currently, we cannot produce color logos on our drinkware. Our stainless-steel drinkware is laser-marked to produce a permanent black logo with a matte black finish. On our DuraCoat drinkware, an ablation process removes the paint coating to reveal the logo on the underlying stainless steel.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We will provide a virtual proof for approval before orders are processed.
