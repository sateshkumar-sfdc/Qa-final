    <textOnly>Hello!


Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your Hopper 40. We are sorry to hear that your zipper broke.


We would like to replace your cooler for you. We are, however, no longer carrying the YETI Hopper 40 and will need to confirm if you would like to move into one of the following:



YETI Hopper TWO 30 (Tahoe Blue or Tan) + Sidekick Dry

Tundra 45- White, Desert Tan or Ice Blue



Please let us know how you would like to proceed and weâ€™ll get your warranty taken care of!


Have a great day!
