    <textOnly>Hello!


Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your Hopper 20. We are sorry to hear that your zipper broke.


We would love to replace your cooler for you. We are, however, no longer carrying the YETI Hopper 20 and will need to confirm if you would like to move into one of the following:


YETI Hopper TWO 30 (Gray or Tan)

YETI Flip 18 (Gray or Tan)


Please let us know how you would like to proceed and weâ€™ll get your warranty taken care of!


Have a great day!
