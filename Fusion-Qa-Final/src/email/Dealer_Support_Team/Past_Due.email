Hello ,

I hope you are well! I wanted to touch base as there is a past due amount on your account currently preventing us from shipping requested orders. I have a snap shot below of what is currently open on your account. 

If you already have payment in route please feel free to disregard this message.

Let us know if you have any questions. Thanks!
